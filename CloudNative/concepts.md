CloudNative needs speeds and agility..
new features, faster release of features to maintain competition.

Cloud Native Arch starts with:
   - CleanCode
   - Domain Driven Development
   - Microservices pattern
   - Kubernetes Patterns

Infrastructure is provisioned, it becomes immutable and disposed
Never updated but re-provisioned

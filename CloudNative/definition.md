- Its a way to architect and build systems and use of cloud infrastructure.
- Cloud Native enables org to build and run scalable applications in a modern, dynamic env such as publlic, private and hybrid cloud systems.
- Cloud Native uses Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastucture and declarative API's.
- Immutable infrastructure means we don't update sometings but replace them with a newer version.
This CloudNative technologies enable:
- **Loosely coupled** systems which means funcionality are exposed through APIs.
- Observable through the use of metrics
- creation and updates are automated

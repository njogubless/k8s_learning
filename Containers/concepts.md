A container is a unit of deployment.
It contains everything for the code to run eg.. 
   - Code.
   - Runtime
   - System tools
   - System libraries

Why use containers?? 
    - much faster to deploy something small than something big
    - Use fewer rsources
    - since they are small use the same server
    - Faster automation
    - Can be run anywhere
    - Isolated from each other- if one fails it will not affect the whole system

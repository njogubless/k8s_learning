#Instead of telling Kubernetes “spawn 1000 Pods,” you run a queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS, Kafka, or even a Kubernetes-native JobQueue pattern).
#You create 1000 tasks in the queue.
#You run a Deployment of worker Pods.
#Cluster Autoscaler + HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) dynamically adjusts Pod count depending on backlog / CPU load.
#your queue system reports backlog size → HPA scales Pods up/down.
#No need to decide parallelism upfront — the system self-adjusts.
